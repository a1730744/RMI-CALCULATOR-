    pushOperation method for handling different operations on a stack looks good,

      on the elements of a stack and then replaces the contents of the stack with
      the result of the operation.

    LCM stands for Least Common Multiple. It is the smallest positive integer

    The lcm method calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two integers,

     divisible by both a and b. This method relies on the mathematical
     relationship between the greatest common divisor (GCD) and the LCM, which

    In the method, integer division is used to prevent overflow that might occur
    with large numbers when multiplying a and b directly.
